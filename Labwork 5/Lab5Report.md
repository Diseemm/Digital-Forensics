## Introduction

### What is Digital Forensics

**Digital forensics** (sometimes known as digital forensic science) is a branch of forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. In this document, descriptions and examples will be provided to analyze Digital Forensics in Images Processing.

### Techniques in detecting images tampering

A few techniques can be named such as:

1. Re-sampling.
2. Double JPEG Compression.
3. Luminance Non-linearities.
4. Signal to Noise Ratio.

### The importance

Digital Forensics helps identifying direct evidence of a crime, digital forensics can be used to attribute evidence to specific suspects, confirm alibis or statements, determine intent, identify sources (for example, in copyright cases), or authenticate documents.

## Methods

### Re-sampling

### Double JPEG Compression

### Luminance Non-linearities

### Signal to Noise Ratio
